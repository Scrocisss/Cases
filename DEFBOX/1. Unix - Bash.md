# 1. Exit code

### Task

Determine the exit code returned by the program /defbox-course/Foundations/bin/exit_code.

### Theory

In Unix, an exit code (or exit status) is a numeric value returned by a command or script to indicate its outcome.
A successful execution typically returns 0, while non-zero values indicate errors or specific failure conditions. The exit code can be accessed using $? in the shell. Standard conventions include 1 for general errors, 2 for misuse of shell commands, and values 128+N for signals (e.g., 137 for SIGKILL).

### Solve

Задача учит тому, что мы можем получить код завершения программы используя символ &, вот так:

```bash
./exit_code &

[1]+  Exit 47                 ./exit_code
```

# 2. Pipes

### Task
In the /defbox-course/Foundations/bin/pipes/ directory, use a pipe to redirect output from pipes_generator to pipes_reader.

### Theory
In Unix, a pipe (|) is a mechanism that allows the output of one command to be used as the input for another. It enables chaining commands together to perform complex tasks efficiently. Pipes facilitate inter-process communication without creating temporary files.

### Example:

```bash
$ ls -l | grep "txt" | wc -l
```

In this example, ls -l lists files, grep "txt" filters the results, and wc -l counts the number of lines.

Pipes operate in a unidirectional, sequential manner and process data in a streaming fashion, improving performance by handling data in chunks.
