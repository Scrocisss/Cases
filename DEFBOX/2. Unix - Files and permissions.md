# Create a file and set specific permissions

### Task
Create a new directory /home/defbox/files.
Inside this directory, create a file called testfile.txt and set its permissions so that the owner has read and write permissions, the group has read-only permissions, and others have no permissions.

### Theory
In Unix, file permissions control who can read, write, or execute a file. Permissions are represented as r (read), w (write), x (execute) for three groups: owner, group, and others (e.g., rwxr-xr--).

Using chmod to Change Permissions:
Syntax:

chmod [options] mode file
Examples:

Numeric (octal) mode:
chmod 755 file  # Owner: rwx, Group: r-x, Others: r-x
Symbolic mode:

```bash
chmod u+x file  # Add execute for the owner
chmod g-w file  # Remove write for the group
chmod o=r file  # Set read-only for others
```

Common octal values:

```bash
777 – Full access (rwxrwxrwx)
644 – Read/write for owner, read-only for others (rw-r--r--)
600 – Owner-only read/write (rw-------)
```

### Solve

```bash
root@bash-exersizes:~# mkdir /home/defbox/files
root@bash-exersizes:~# cd /home/defbox/files
root@bash-exersizes:/home/defbox/files# touch testfile.txt
root@bash-exersizes:/home/defbox/files# chmod 640 testfile.txt
root@bash-exersizes:/home/defbox/files# ls -la testfile.txt 
-rw-r----- 1 root root 0 Aug 14 12:00 testfile.txt
```

### TIP 

Note that you can set file permissions with chmod using numbers (like 640) or symbols (like o-rwx).

# Modify ownership and permissions

### Task
Change the ownership of testfile.txt (created in the previous task) so that ownership is set to defbox, and the group ownership is set to students.
Ensure the owner still has read and write access, and that the group has both read and write access.

### Solve

```bash
root@bash-exersizes:/home/defbox/files# ls -la
total 8
drwxr-xr-x 2 root   root   4096 Aug 14 12:00 .
drwxr-x--- 5 defbox defbox 4096 Aug 14 12:00 ..
-rw-r----- 1 root   root      0 Aug 14 12:00 testfile.txt
root@bash-exersizes:/home/defbox/files# chown defbox:students testfile.txt
root@bash-exersizes:/home/defbox/files# ls -la testfile.txt 
-rw-r----- 1 defbox students 0 Aug 14 12:00 testfile.txt
```

### TIP

To change the group ownership of a file, utilize the following syntax: $ chown :group1 file1.txt

# Create a symbolic and hard link

### Task
In the /home/defbox/files/ directory, create two links:

A hard link named hardlink.txt that points to testfile.txt.
A symbolic link named symlink.txt that points to testfile.txt.
 

### Theory
In Unix, symlinks (symbolic links) are special files that point to another file or directory. There are two types:

1. Soft Link (Symbolic Link)
Points to the target file's path.
If the target is deleted, the soft link becomes broken (dangling link).
Can link to directories or files across different filesystems.

Example:

```bash
ln -s target_file link_name
```

2. Hard Link
Points directly to the file's inode (data on disk).
Even if the original file is deleted, the data remains accessible via the hard link.
Cannot link to directories or span across filesystems.

Example:

```bash
ln target_file link_name
```

| Feature               | Soft Link                  | Hard Link                  |
|-----------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Points to**         | File path                 | Inode                     |
| **Cross-filesystem**  | Yes                       | No                        |
| **Works with dirs**   | Yes                       | No                        |
| **If target deleted** | Broken (dangling)         | Still works               |
| **Command**           | `ln -s target link_name`  | `ln target link_name`     |
